    <h3>Problems i found</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Eslint loader didnt work properly with res to create a new AddTodo, so i coudnt use the page in the final step, SOLVED with () </li>
      <li>When creating the id for the AddTodo, before using jsonPlaceHolder, it couldnt read the v4, showed 2 warnings maybe because of the version of the vue, i installed the latest one.</li>
      <li>Couldnt build the dist folder, becuase of the eslint error, it wouldnt compile.</li>
    </ul>
